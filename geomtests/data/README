File Formats
------------

All data files are offered in human readable ASCII (.txt suffix) and in
binary format (.bin suffix). All programs are able to read both formats.
Two small helper programs, points2bin and bin2points, are able to
convert between the two formats.

ASCII Format:

Points are stored as pairs of doubles, first the x- and then the y-coordinate, 
with 18 digits precision separated by white spaces. A file is read until
the end-of-file (EOF) condition holds.

Binary Format:

The file starts with an 8 byte magic header to identify it as a binary file
and to make it automatically detectable for the file parser whether to 
read a file as ASCII or as binary data. The magic header string is in 
C string notation: "BINARY\nB". It needs to be written and read in 
binary file IO mode, otherwise the "\n" might be converted and the 
binary format will be corrupted (and an error message will be printed
when attempting to read the file).

After the header string, points are stored as pairs of doubles, first the 
x- and then the y-coordinate, in 8 byte binary representation in
little-endian format (Intel processors are little endian). The supporting
function in the src directory automatically detect the endianness of the
current machine and convert the data automatically if necessary.
A file is read until the end-of-file (EOF) condition holds.
