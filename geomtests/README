The distribution is organized in subdirectories, each with its own README:

  ./src/        programs, makefiles, installation and experiment instructions
  ./data/       input data for the experiments and programs
  ./images/     result images used in paper and more

See in particular the following files for more information:

  ./src/README           introduction to the programs and installation
  ./src/Experiments.txt  instructions how to run the experiments
  ./data/README          input data file formats
