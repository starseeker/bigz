The Bignum package was originally written by DEC & INRIA to provide
an efficient infinite arithmetic precision C library.

Chistian Jullien from Eligis was using this package for his Intel
Le-Lisp ports since 1988. In 1999 he decided to use and maintain this
package for it's own Lisp implementation called OpenLisp (a full
ISO/IEC 13816:2007(E) ISLISP Language implementation).

On 2011-12-05, Bernard-Paul Serpette from INRIA granted Christian
Jullien the persmission to create a sourceforge.net project under
Simplified BSD License to continue this development.

You can retrieve the source code on sourceforge using;

  svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/bigz/code-0/trunk bigz-code-0
