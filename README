The  Bignum  package was originally written by DEC & INRIA to provide
an  efficient infinite arithmetic precision C library.

Chistian  Jullien  from  Eligis  was using this package for his Intel
Le-Lisp ports since 1988. In 1999 he decided to use and maintain this
package  for  it's  own  Lisp  implementation called OpenLisp (a full
ISO/IEC 13816:2007(E) ISLISP Language implementation).

On 2011-12-05,  Bernard-Paul  Serpette  from INRIA  granted Christian
Jullien the  persmission to create  a sourceforge.net  project  under
Simplified BSD License to continue this development.

This directory contains the C/C++ source code for BigNum.

   Documentation files:
	doc/bn.tex	  - Document BigNum in LaTeX format
	doc/bnf.tex       - Document BigNum in French and LaTeX format
	doc/makeidx.sty	  - macro used in BigNum document

   C Include Files:
	bign.h		  - Types and structures for clients of BigNum
	bigz.h		  - Types and structures for clients of BigZ
	bigq.h		  - Types and structures for clients of BigG

   C Source Code:
	bign.c	          - BigNum implementation ("kernel" routines)
	bigz.c		  - BigZ implementation
	bigq.c		  - BigQ implementation (on top of BigZ)
	bzf.c		  - Miscellaneous functions built on top of BigZ

   Test files:

	lisp/lisptest.lsp - CLtL/OpenLisp code used to generate OpenLisp tests.

If you have the tools LaTeX, makeindex and aptex, type:
	make doc	  - to build the Postscript files of the documents

You can retrieve the source code on sourceforge using;
